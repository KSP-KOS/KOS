<p>Using the COPY, SWITCH, DELETE, and RENAME commands, you can manipulate the archive and the volumes as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="../commands/files.html#files"><em>File I/O page</em></a>. But before you do that, it&#8217;s useful to know how kOS manages the archive and the volumes, and what they mean.</p>

<p>The Archive where KerboScript files are kept has been changed from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Plugins/PluginData/Archive</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ships/Script</span></tt>, but still under the top-level <strong>KSP</strong> installation directory.

<p>There is one file per program. You can use the words &#8220;file&#8221; and &#8220;program&#8221; interchangeably in your thinking for the most part. Files are stored in volumes and there can be more than one file in a volume provided there&#8217;s enough room. Volumes have small storage and there&#8217;s no way to span a file across two volumes, so the limit to the size of a volume is also effectively a limit to the size of a program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-storage-behind-the-scenes">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">File Storage Behind the Scenes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#file-storage-behind-the-scenes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the Archive:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If a file is stored on the volume called &#8220;Archive&#8221; (or volume number
zero to put it another way), then behind the scenes it&#8217;s really
stored as an actual file, with the extension <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.ks</span></tt>, on your
computer (As of right now it&#8217;s located in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ships/Script</span></tt> but that
location is likely to change to somewhere in GameData in a future
version.) Each program is a simple text file you can edit with any
text editor, and your edits will be seen immediately by KOS the next
time it tries running that program from the archive volume.</li>
<li>Historical note: older versions of kOS (0.14 and earlier) used the
directory <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Plugins/PluginData/Archive</span></tt> for the archive.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any other volume besides Archive:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If a file is stored on any volume other than archive, then behind the
scenes it&#8217;s stored actually inside the saved game&#8217;s persistence file
in the section for the KOS part on the vessel.
What&#8217;s a Volume</li>
</ul>
<p>A Volume is a small unit of disk storage that contains a single hard
drive with very limited storage capacity. It can store more than one
program on it. To simulate the sense that this game takes place at the
dawn of the space race with 1960&#8217;s and 1970&#8217;s technology, the storage
capacity of a volume is very limited. It can only store 10,000 bytes of
program text - less than 10 Kb The byte count of a program is just the
count of the characters in the source code text. Writing programs with
short cryptic variable names instead of long descriptive ones does save
space. This is old school programming, where squeezing every byte out
matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-volumes-on-one-vessel">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Multiple Volumes on One Vessel</a><a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-volumes-on-one-vessel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each kOS CX-4181 Scriptable Control System part contains &#8216;&#8217;&#8216;one&#8217;&#8216;&#8217; such
volume inside it. Therefore to send a craft into space with more storage
capacity than 10,000 bytes requires putting multiple CX-4181 Scriptable
Control System parts on the craft.</p>
<p>If you have multiple CX-4181 parts on the same craft, they are assumed
to be networked together on the same system, and capable of reading each
other&#8217;s hard drives. Their disk drives each have a different Volume, and
by default they are simply numbered 1,2,3, … unless you rename them with
the RENAME command.</p>
<p>For example, if you have two CX-4181&#8217;s on the same craft, called 1 and
2, with volumes on them called 1 and 2, respectively, it is possible for
CPU 1 to run code stored on volume 2 by just having CPU number 1 issue
the command &#8216;&#8217;SWITCH TO 2.&#8217;&#8216;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naming-volumes">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Naming Volumes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#naming-volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that if you have multiple volumes on the same
vessel, the numbering conventions for the volumes will differ on
different CPUs. The same volume which was called &#8216;2&#8217; when one CPU was
looking at it might instead be called &#8216;1&#8217; when a different CPU is
looking at it. Each CPU thinks of its OWN volume as number &#8216;1&#8217;.</p>
<p>Therefore using the RENAME command on the volumes is useful when dealing
with multiple CX-4181&#8217;s on the same vessel, so they all will refer to
the volumes using the same names.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="archive">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Archive</a><a class="headerlink" href="#archive" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The &#8220;archive&#8221; is a special volume that behaves much like any other
volume but with the following exceptions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is globally the same even across save games.</li>
<li>The archive represents the large bank of disk storage back at mission
control&#8217;s mainframe, rather than the storage on an indivdual craft.
While &#8220;Volume 1&#8221; on one vessel might be a different disk than &#8220;Volume
1&#8221; on another vessel, there is only volume called &#8220;archive&#8221; in the
entire solar system. Also, there&#8217;s only one &#8220;archive&#8221; across all
saved universes. If you play a new campaign from scratch, your
archive in that new game will still have all the files in it from
your previous saved game. This is because behid the scenes it&#8217;s
stored in the plugin&#8217;s directory, not the save game directory.</li>
<li>It is infinitely large.</li>
<li>Unlike the other volumes, the archive volume does not have a byte
limit. This is because the mainframe back at home base can store a
lot more than the special drives sent on the vessels - so much so
that it may as well be infinite by comparison.</li>
<li>Files saved there do not revert when you &#8220;revert flight&#8221;.</li>
<li>When you revert a flight, you are going back to a previous saved
state of the game, and therefore any disk data on the vessels
themselves also reverts to what it was at the time of the saved game.
Because the archive is saved outside the normal game save, changes
made there are retained even when reverting a flight.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s not always reachable if you are out in space, unless you have
antennae.</li>
<li>Once a vessel is more than 100,000 meters away from mission control,
by default it cannot access the files on the archive. Commands such
as SWITCH TO , and COPY FROM will fail to work when trying to access
the archive volume while out of range. This can be changed by putting
antennae on the vessel. With enough
<a class="reference external" href="/KOS_DOC/summary_topics/commrange">antennae</a> it becomes possible
to reach the archive drive from farther away. Using this method it is
possible to alter the software stored on a vessel after launch.</li>
<li>Files in Archive are editable with a text editor directly and they
will have the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.ks</span></tt> extension.</li>
<li>Files in the Archive are stored on your computer in the subdirectory:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Ships/Script</span></tt>. You can pull them up in a text editor of your
choice and edit them directly, and the KOS Mod will see those changes
in its archive immediately. Files stored in other volumes, on the
other hand, are stored inside the vessel&#8217;s data in the persistence
file of the saved game and are quite a bit bit harder to edit there.
Editing the files in the Archive directory is allowed and in fact is
an officially accepted way to use the plugin. Editing the section in
a persistence file, on the other hand, is a bad idea and probably
constitutes a form of cheating similar to any other edit of the
persistence file.</li>
