    * Inactive (default)
        - Transfer is stopped
    * Finished 
        - Transfer has reached its goal

.. attribute:: RESOURCETRANSFER:MESSAGE

    :access: Get only
    :type: string

    This shows the detail related to :attr:`STATUS`
    
.. attribute:: RESOURCETRANSFER:GOAL

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar
    
    If you specified an amount to transfer in your transfer request, it will be shown here.
    If you did not, this will return the sentinel value -1.

.. attribute:: RESOURCETRANSFER:TRANSFERRED

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    Returns the amount of the specified resource that has been transferred by this resource transfer.
    
.. attribute:: RESOURCETRANSFER:RESOURCE

    :access: Get only
    :type: string

    The name of the resource that will be transferred. (eg, oxidizer, liquidfuel)
    
.. attribute:: RESOURCETRANSFER:ACTIVE

    :access: Get / Set
    :type: bool

    When getting, this suffix is simply a shortcut to tell you if :attr:`STATUS` is Transferring.
    Setting true will change the status of the transfer to Transferring, setting false will change status to inactive.
