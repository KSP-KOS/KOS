Engine
======

Some of the Parts returned by :ref:`LIST PARTS <list command>` will be of type Engine. It is also possible to get just the Engine parts by executing ``LIST ENGINES``, for example::

    LIST ENGINES IN myVariable.
    FOR eng IN myVariable {
        print "An engine exists with ISP = " + eng:ISP.
    }.

.. note::

    :struct:`Engine` is a type of :struct:`Part`, and therefore can use all the suffixes of :struct:`Part`. Shown below are only the suffixes that are unique to :struct:`Engine`.



.. method:: Engine:ACTIVATE

    Call to make the engine turn on.

.. method:: Engine:SHUTDOWN

    Call to make the engine turn off.

.. attribute:: Engine:THRUSTLIMIT

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: scalar (%)

    If this an engine with a thrust limiter (tweakable) enabled, what percentage is it limited to?

.. attribute:: Engine:MAXTHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar (kN)

    How much thrust would this engine give if the throttle was max and conditions were ideal.

.. attribute:: Engine:THRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar (kN)

    How much thrust is this engine giving at this very moment.

.. attribute:: Engine:FUELFLOW

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar (Liters/s? maybe)

    Rate at which fuel is being burned. Not sure what the units are.

.. attribute:: Engine:ISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    `Specific impulse <isp>`_

.. attribute:: Engine:VACUUMISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    `Vacuum Specific impulse <isp>`_

.. attribute:: Engine:VISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    `Synonym for :VACUUMISP`_

.. attribute:: Engine:SEALEVELISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    `Specific impulse at Kerbin sealevel <isp>`_

.. attribute:: Engine:SLISP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    `Synonym for :SEALEVELISP`_

.. attribute:: Engine:FLAMEOUT

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Is this engine failed because it is starved of a resource (liquidfuel, oxidizer, oxygen)?

.. attribute:: Engine:IGNITION

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Has this engine been ignited? If both :attr:`Engine:IGNITION` and :attr:`Engine:FLAMEOUT` are true, that means the engine could start up again immediately if more resources were made available to it.

.. attribute:: Engine:ALLOWRESTART

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Is this an engine that can be started again? Usually True, but false for solid boosters.

.. attribute:: Engine:ALLOWSHUTDOWN

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Is this an engine that can be shut off once started? Usually True, but false for solid boosters.

.. attribute:: Engine:THROTTLELOCK

    :access: Get only
    :type: boolean

    Is this an engine that is stuck at a fixed throttle? (i.e. solid boosters)
