Changes from version to version
===============================

This is a slightly more verbose version of the new features
mentioned in the CHANGELOG, specifically for new features and for
users familiar with older versions of the documentation who want
only a quick update to the docs without reading the entire set
of documentation again from scratch.

Changes in 0.17.0
-----------------

Variables can now be local
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Previously, the kOS runtime had a serious limitation in which
it could only support one flat namespace of global-only variables.
Considerable archetecture re-work has been done to now support
:ref:`block-scoping <scope>` in the underlying runtime, which can
be controlled through the use of :ref:`local declarations <declare syntax>`
in your kerboscript files.

Kerboscript has User Functions
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The primary reason for the local scope variables rework was in
support of the new :ref:`user functions feature <user_functions>`
which has been a long-wished-for feature for kOS to support.

Community Examples Library
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

There is now a :ref:`new fledgling repository of examples and library
scripts<library>` that we hope to be something the user community
contributes to.  Some of the examples shown in the kOS 0.17.0 release
video are located there.  The addition of the ability to make user
functions now makes the creation of such a library a viable option.

Physics Ticks not Update Ticks
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The updates have been :ref:`moved to the physics update <physics tick>`
portion of Unity, instead of the animation frame rate updates.
This may affect your preferred CONFIG:IPU setting.  The new move
creates a much more uniform performance across all users, without
penalizing the users of faster computers anymore.  (Previously,
if your computer was faster, you'd be charged more electricity as
the updates came more often).

Ability to use SAS modes from KSP 0.90
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Added a new :ref:`third way to control the ship <sasmode>`,
by leaving SAS on, and just telling KSP which mode
(prograde, retrograde, normal, etc) to put the SAS
into.

Blizzy ToolBar Support
::::::::::::::::::::::

If you have the Blizzy Toolbar mod installed, you should be able
to put the kOS control panel window under its control.

Ability to define colors using HSV
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

When a color is called for, such as with VECDRAW or HIGHLIGHT, you
can now use the :ref:`HSV color system (hue, saturation, value)<hsv>`
instead of RGB, if you prefer.

Ability to highlight a part in color
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Any time your script needs to communicate something to the user about
which part or parts it's dealing with, it can use KSP's :ref:`part
highlighting feature <highlight>` to show a part.

Better user interface for selecting boot scripts
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The selection of :ref:`boot scripts for your vessel <boot>` has been
improved.

Disks can be made bigger with tweakable slider
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

All parts that have disk space now have a slider you can use in the VAB
or SPH editors to tweak the disk space to choose whether you want it to
have 1x, 2x, or 4x as much as its default size.  Increasing the size
increases its price and its weight cost.

You Can Transfer Resources
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You can now use kOS scripts to :ref:`transfer resources between
parts <resource transfer>` for things like fuel, in the same way
that a manual user can do by using the right-click menus.

Kerbal Alarm Clock support
::::::::::::::::::::::::::

If you have the Kerbal Alarm Clock Mod isntalled, you can now
:ref:`query and manipulate its alarms <KAC>` from within your
kOS scripts.

Query the docked elements of a vessel
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You can get the :ref:`docked components of a joined-together
vessel <element>` as separate collections of parts now.

Support for Action Groups Extended
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

While there was some support for the Action Groups Extended
mod before, it has :ref:`been greatly improved <AGX>`.
