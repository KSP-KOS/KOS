File I/O
========

For information about where files are kept and how to deal with volumes see the :ref:`Volumes <volumes>` page in the general topics section of this documentation.

.. note::

    All file names (program names) must be valid Identifiers. They can not contain spaces or special characters. For example, you can't have a file name called "this is my-file".

    .. versionchanged:: 0.15

        **Archive location and file extension change**

        The Archive where KerboScript files are kept has been changed from ``Plugins/PluginData/Archive`` to ``Ships/Script``, but still under the top-level **KSP** installation directory. The file name extensions have also changes from ``.txt`` to ``.ks``.

Volume and Filename arguments
-----------------------------

Any of the commands below which use filename arguments, \*\*with the
exception
of the RUN command\*\*, follow these rules:

-  (expression filenames) A filename may be an expression which
   evaluates to a string.
-  (bareword filenames) A filename may also be an undefined identifier
   which does not match a variable name, in which case the bare word
   name of the identifier will be used as the filename. If the
   identifier does match a variable name, then it will be evaluated as
   an expression and the variable's contents will be used as the
   filename.
-  A bareword filename may contain file extensions with dots, provided
   it does not end in a dot.
-  If the filename does not contain a file extension, kOS will pad it
   with a ".ks" extension and use that.

Putting the above rules together, you can refer to filenames in any of
the following ways:

-  copy myfilename to 1. // This is an example of a bareword filename.
-  copy "myfilename" to 1. // This is an example of an EXPRESSION
   filename.
-  copy myfilename.ks to 1. // This is an example of a bareword
   filename.
-  copy myfilename.txt to 1. // This is an example of a bareword
   filename.
-  copy "myfilename.ks" to 1. // This is an example of an EXPRESSION
   filename
-  set str to "myfile" + "name" + ".ks". copy str to 1. // This is an
   example of an EXPRESSION filename

**Limits:**

The following rules apply as limitations to the bareword filenames:

-  The **RUN command only works with bareword filenames**, not
   expression filenames. Every other command works with either type of
   filename.
-  Filenames containing any characters other than A-Z, 0-9, underscore,
   and the period extension separator ('.'), can only be referred to
   using a string expression (with quotes), and cannot be used as a
   bareword expression (without quotes).
-  If your filesystem is case-sensitive (Linux and sometimes Mac OSX, or
   even Windows if using some kinds of remote network drives), then
   bareword filenames will only work properly on filenames that are all
   lowercase. If you try to use a file with capital letters in the name
   on these systems, you will only be able to do so by quoting it.

**Volumes too:**

The rules for filenames also apply to volumes. You may do this for
example:

-  set volNum to 1. copy "myfile" to volNum.


``COMPILE program (TO compiledProgram).``
-----------------------------------------

**(experimental)**

Arguments:

    argument 1
        Name of source file.
    argument 2
        Name of destination file. If the optional argument 2 is missing, it will assume it's the same as argument 1, but with a file extension changed to ``*.ksm``.

Pre-compiles a script into an :ref:`Kerboscript ML Exceutable
image <compiling>` that can be used
instead of executing the program script directly.

The RUN command (elsewhere on this page) can work with either \*.ks
script files or \*.ksm compiled files.

The full details of this process are long and complex enough to be
placed on a separate page.

Please see :ref:`the details of the Kerboscript ML
Executable <compiling>`.

``COPY programFile FROM/TO voumeNumber.``
-----------------------------------------

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

-  argument 1: Name of target file.
-  argument 2: Target volume.

Copies a file to or from another volume. Volumes can be referenced by
their ID numbers or their names if they’ve been given one. See LIST,
SWITCH and RENAME.

Understanding how :ref:`volumes
work <volumes>` is important to
understanding this command.

Example::

    SWITCH TO 1.             // Makes volume 1 the active volume
    COPY file1 FROM 0.       // Copies a file called file1.ks from volume 0 to volume 1
    COPY file2 TO 0.         // Copies a file called file1.ks from volume 1 to volume 0
    COPY file1.ks FROM 0.    // Copies a file called file1.ks from volume 0 to volume 1
    COPY file2.ksm TO 0.     // Copies a file called file1.ksm from volume 1 to volume 0
    COPY "file1.ksm" FROM 0. // Copies a file called file1.ksm from volume 0 to volume 1
    COPY "file1" + "." + "ks" FROM 0. // Copies a file called file1.ks from volume 0 to volume 1


``DELETE filename FROM volumeNumber.``
--------------------------------------

Deletes a file. You can delete a file from the current volume, or from a named volume.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

-  argument 1: Name of target file.
-  argument 2: (optional) Target volume.

Example::

    DELETE file1.         // Deletes file1.ks from the active volume.
    DELETE "file1".       // Deletes file1.ks from the active volume.
    DELETE file1.txt.     // Deletes file1.txt from the active volume.
    DELETE "file1.txt".   // Deletes file1.txt from the active volume.
    DELETE file1 FROM 1.  // Deletes file1.ks from volume 1


``EDIT program.``
-----------------

Edits a program on the currently selected volume.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

-  argument 1: Name of file for editing.

.. note::

    The Edit feature was lost in version 0.11 but is back again after version 0.12.2 under a new guise. The new editor is unable to show a monospace font for a series of complex reasons involving how Unity works and how squad bundled the KSP game. The editor works, but will be in a proportional width font, which isn't ideal for editing code. The best way to edit code remains to use a text editor external to KSP, however for a fast peek at the code during play, this editor is useful.

Example::

    EDIT filename.       // edits filename.ks
    EDIT filename.ks.    // edits filename.ks
    EDIT "filename.ks".  // edits filename.ks
    EDIT "filename".     // edits filename.ks
    EDIT "filename.txt". // edits filename.txt


``LOG text TO filename.``
-------------------------

Logs the selected text to a file on the local volume. Can print strings, or the result of an expression.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

-  argument 1: Value you would like to log.
-  argument 2: Name of file to log into.

Example::

    LOG “Hello” to mylog.txt.    // logs to "mylog.txt".
    LOG 4+1 to "mylog" .         // logs to "mylog.ks" because .ks is the default extension.
    LOG “4 times 8 is: “ + (4*8) to mylog.   // logs to mylog.ks because .ks is the default extension.


``RENAME name1 TO name2.``
--------------------------

Renames a file or volume.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

-  argument 1: Volume/File Name you would like to change.
-  argument 2: New name for $1.

Example::

    RENAME VOLUME 1 TO AwesomeDisk
    RENAME FILE MyFile TO AutoLaunch.

``RUN <program>.``
------------------

Runs the specified file as a program, optionally passing information to the program in the form of a comma-separated list of arguments in parentheses.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

-  <program>: File to run.
-  comma-separated-args: a list of values to pass into the program.

Example::

    RUN AutoLaunch.ks.
    RUN AutoLaunch.ksm.
    RUN AutoLaunch.      // runs AutoLaunch.ksm if available, else runs AutoLaunch.ks.
    RUN AutoLaunch( 75000, true, "hello" ).
    RUN AutoLaunch.ks( 75000, true, "hello" ).
    RUN AutoLaunch.ksm( 75000, true, "hello" ).

The program that is reading the arguments sees them in the variables it
mentions in :ref:`DECLARE PARAMETER`.

Important exceptions to the usual filename rules for RUN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RUN command does not allow the same sorts of generic open-ended
filenames that the other
file commands allow. This is very important.

RUN only works when the filename is a bareword filename. It cannot use expression filenames::

    RUN "ProgName"   // THIS WILL FAIL.  Run needs a bareword filename.
    SET ProgName to "MyProgram".
    RUN ProgName     // THIS WILL FAIL also.  It will attempt to run a file
                     // called "ProgName.ksm" or "ProgName.ks", when it sees this,
                     // rather than "MyProgram".

    The reasons for the exception to how filenames work for the RUN
    command are too complex to go into in large detail here. Here's the
    short version: While the kOS system does defer the majority of the
    work
    of actually compiling subprogram scripts until run-time, it still
    has to
    generate some header info about them at compile time, and the
    filename
    has to be set in stone at that time. Changing this would require a
    large re-write of some of the architecture of the virtual machine.


``SWITCH TO <volumeNumber>.``
-----------------------------

Switches to the specified volume. Volumes can be specified by number, or
it’s name (if it has one). See LIST and RENAME. Understanding how
:ref:`volumes work <volumes>` is important
to understanding this command.

Example::

    SWITCH TO 0.                        // Switch to volume 0.
    RENAME VOLUME 1 TO AwesomeDisk.     // Name volume 1 as AwesomeDisk.
    SWITCH TO AwesomeDisk.              // Switch to volume 1.
    PRINT VOLUME:NAME.                  // Prints "AwesomeDisk".

.. _boot:

Special handling of files starting with "boot" (example ``boot.ks``)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**(experimental)**

For users requiring even more automation, the feature of custom boot scripts was introduced. If you have at least 1 file in your Archive volume starting with "boot" (for example "boot.ks", "boot2.ks" or even "boot_custom_script.ks"), you will be presented with the option to choose one of those files as a boot script for your kOS CPU.
 
.. image:: http://i.imgur.com/05kp7Sy.jpg

As soon as you vessel leaves VAB/SPH and is being initialised on the launchpad (e.g. its status is PRELAUNCH) the assigned script will be copied to CPU's local hard disk and named "boot.ks". This script will be run as soon as CPU boots, e.g. as soon as you bring your CPU in physics range or power on your CPU if it was turned off.

Important things to consider:
	* kOS CPU hard disk space is limited, avoid using complex boot scripts or increase disk space using MM config.
	* If your kOS set to start from Archive, this feature may not work as intended. Possible workaround: disable starting from Archive and create simple default "boot.ks" file like this::
		
		//default boot script, just switches to Archive
		switch to 0.
		
	* Boot script runs immediately on initialisation, it should avoid interaction with parts/modules until physics fully load. It is best to wait for couple seconds or until certain trigger.
	
	
Possible uses for boot scripts:

	* Automatically activate sleeper/background scripts which will run on CPU until triggered by certain condition.
	* Create basic station-keeping scripts - you will only have to focus your probes once in a while and let the boot script do the orbit adjustment automatically.
	* Create multi-CPU vessels with certain cores dedicated to specific tasks, triggered by user input or external events (Robotic-heavy Vessels)
	* Anything else you can come up with
