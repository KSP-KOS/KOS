.. index:: LIST (command)

``LIST`` Command
================

A :struct:`List` is a type of :ref:`Structure <features structures>` that stores a list of variables in it. The ``LIST`` command either prints or crates a :struct:`List` object containing items queried from the game. For more information, see the :ref:`page about the List structure <list>`.

``FOR`` Loop
------------

Lists need to be iterated over sometimes, to help with this we have the :ref:`FOR loop, explained on the flow control page <for>`. The ``LIST`` Command comes in 4 forms:

1. ``LIST.``
    When no parameters are given, the LIST command is exactly equivalent to the command::

        LIST FILES.
        
2. ``LIST ListKeyword.``
    This variant prints items to the termianl sceen. Depending on the *ListKeyword* used (see below), different values are printed.
    
3. ``LIST ListKeyword IN YourVariable.``
    This variant takes the items that would otherwise have been printed to the terminal screen, and instead makes a :struct:`List` of them in ``YourVariable``, that you can then iterate over with a :ref:`FOR loop <for>` if you like.
    
4. ``LIST ListKeyword FROM SomeVessel IN YourVariable.``
    This variant is just like variant (3), except that it gives a list of the items that exist on some other vessel that might not necessarily be the current :ref:`CPU_vessel <cpu vessel>`.

Available Listable Keywords
---------------------------

The *ListKeyword* in the above command variants can be any of the
following:

Universal Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These generate :struct:`lists <List>` that are not dependent on which :struct:`Vessel`:

``Bodies``
    :struct:`List` of :struct:`Celestial Bodies <Body>`
    
``Targets``
    :struct:`List` of possible target :struct:`Vessels <Vessel>`

Vessel Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^

These generate :struct:`lists <List>` of items on the :struct:`Vessel`:

``Resources``
    :struct:`List` of :struct:`AggregateResources <Resource>`
``Parts``
    :struct:`List` of :struct:`Parts <Part>`
``Engines``
    :struct:`List` of :struct:`Engines <Engine>`
``Sensors``
    :struct:`List` of :struct:`Sensors <Sensor>`
``Elements``
    :struct:`List` of :ref:`Elements <element>` that comprise the current vessel.
``DockingPorts``
    list of `DockingPorts <DockingPort>`

File System Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These generate :struct:`lists <List>` about the files in the system:

``Files``
    :struct:`List` the :struct:`files <FileInfo>` on the current Volume. (note below)
``Volumes``
    :struct:`List` all the :ref:`volumes` that exist.

.. note::

    ``LIST FILES.`` is the default if you give the ``LIST`` command no parameters.

Examples::

    LIST.  // Prints the list of files on current volume.
    LIST FILES.  // Does the same exact thing, but more explicitly.
    LIST VOLUMES. // which volumes can be seen by this CPU?
    LIST FILES IN fileList. // fileList is now a LIST() containing file structures.

The file structures returned by ``LIST FILES IN fileList.`` are documented :ref:`on a separate page <fileinfo>`.

Here are some more examples::

    // Prints the list of all
    // Celestial bodies in the system.
    LIST BODIES. 

    // Puts the list of bodies into a variable.
    LIST BODIES IN bodList. 
    // Iterate over everything in the list:
    SET totMass to 0.
    FOR bod in bodList {
        SET totMass to totMass + bod:MASS.
    }.
    PRINT "The mass of the whole solar system is " + totMass.

    // Adds variable foo that contains a list of 
    // resources for my currently target vessel
    LIST RESOURCES FROM TARGET IN foo.
    FOR res IN foo {
        PRINT res:NAME. // Will print the name of every
                        // resource in the vessel
    }.
