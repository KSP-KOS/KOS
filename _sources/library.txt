Community Examples Library
==========================

Starting with version 0.17.0 of kOS, we have decided to support
a separate repository of examples and libraries that "live" entirely
in kerboscript code only.  This is a useful place to find helpful
code written by other users of kOS, some of whom may be members of
the main kOS development team, and some of whom might ber users in the
community.

The separate repository is found here:

https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib

Some examples of useful things you can find there are:

* A generic all-purpose **PID controller** function:

  * library script: https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/library/lib_pid.ks
  * documentation: https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/doc/lib_pid.md
  * example https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/examples/example_lib_pid.ks

* A library for getting **navball orientation** information:

  * library script https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/library/lib_navball.ks
  * documentation https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/doc/lib_navball.md
  * example https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib/blob/master/examples/example_lib_navball.ks

* An example of how to use the :ref:`sasmode <sasmode>` feature:
