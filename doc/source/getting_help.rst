Getting Help
============
Although we do our best to be as clear as possible in the documentation, it is inevitable that some questions will be left unanswered. If you need help in any way, we have several channels for that purpose

Discord
-------
The `Discord server <https://discord.gg/7A5Rhe7>`_ is open for all questions and discussion.

Subreddit
---------
The `kOS subreddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/Kos/>`_ is also a place to ask questions and discussion, many people on the subreddit also share their designs and code, so it is a good place to find examples and inspiration.

Github Issues
-------------
If you find a bug, have a general question about the project, or want to contribute to the project, you can open an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/issues>`_.
