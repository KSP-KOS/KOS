Separator
=========

Some of the Parts returned by :ref:`LIST PARTS <list command>` will be of type :struct:`Separator`.

A separator part is one that detaches a vessel into at least two parts, in a permanent
way (rather than a docking port, which can be re-attached).  Both decouplers and
separators count.
