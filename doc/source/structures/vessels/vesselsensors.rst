VesselSensors
=============

When you ask a Vessel to tell you its :attr:`Vessel:SENSORS` suffix, it returns an object of this type. It is a snapshot of sensor data taken at the moment the sensor reading was requested.

.. note::

    These values are only enabled if you have the proper type of sensor on board the vessel. If you don't have a thermometer, for example, then the :attr:`:TEMP <VesselSensors>` suffix will always read zero.

If you store this in a variable and wait, the numbers are frozen in time and won't change as the vessel's condition changes.

        **BUG**

        This information is currenlty being read from the Active Vessel even when the Active Vessel is not the :ref:`CPU Vessel <cpu vessel>`. This comment will be removed when that bug is fixed.

.. attribute:: VesselSensors:ACC

    :access: Get only
    :type: :struct:`Vector`

    Accelleration the vessel is undergoing. A combination of both the gravitational pull and the engine thrust.

.. attribute:: VesselSensors:PRES

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    The current pressure of this ship.

.. attribute:: VesselSensors:TEMP

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    The current temperature.

.. attribute:: VesselSensors:GRAV

    :access: Get only
    :type: :struct:`Vector`

    Magnitude and direction of gravity acceleration where the vessel currently is. Magnitude is expressed in "G"'s (multiples of 9.802 m/s^2).

.. attribute:: VesselSensors:LIGHT

    :access: Get only
    :type: scalar

    The total amount of sun exposure that exists here - only readable if there are solar panels on the vessel.
