Some of the Parts returned by :ref:`LIST PARTS <list command>` will be of type Engine. It is also possible to get just the Engine parts by executing ``LIST ENGINES``, for example::

    LIST ENGINES IN myVariable.
    FOR eng IN myVariable {
        print "An engine exists with ISP = " + eng:ISP.

.. note::

    :struct:`Engine` is a type of :struct:`Part`, and therefore can use all the suffixes of :struct:`Part`. Shown below are only the suffixes that are unique to :struct:`Engine`.



.. method:: Engine:ACTIVATE

    Call to make the engine turn on.

.. method:: Engine:SHUTDOWN

    Call to make the engine turn off.

.. attribute:: Engine:THRUSTLIMIT

    :access: Get/Set
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (%)

    If this an engine with a thrust limiter (tweakable) enabled, what
    percentage is it limited to?  Note that this is expressed as a 
    percentage, not a simple 0..1 coefficient.  e.g. To set thrustlimit
    to half, you use a value of 50.0, not 0.5.

    This value is not allowed to go outside the range [0..100].  If you
    attempt to do so, it will be clamped down into the allowed range.

    Note that although a kerboscript is allowed to set the value to a
    very precise number (for example 10.5123), the stock in-game display
    widget that pops up when you right-click the engine will automatically
    round it to the nearest 0.5 whenever you open the panel.  So if you
    do something like ``set ship:part[20]:thrustlimit to 10.5123.`` in
    your script, then look at the rightclick menu for the engine, the very
    act of just looking at the menu will cause it to become 10.5 instead 
    of 10.5123.  There isn't much that kOS can do to change this.  It's a
    user interface decision baked into the stock game.

.. _engine_MAXTHRUST:

.. attribute:: Engine:MAXTHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    How much thrust would this engine give at its current atmospheric pressure and velocity if the throttle was max at 1.0, and the thrust limiter was max at 100%.  Note this might not be the engine's actual max thrust it could have under other air pressure conditions.  Some engines have a very different value for MAXTHRUST in vacuum as opposed to at sea level pressure.  Also, some jet engines have a very different value for MAXTHRUST depending on how fast they are currently being rammed through the air. Also note that this will read zero if the engine is currently disabled.

.. _engine_MAXTHRUSTAT:

.. method:: Engine:MAXTHRUSTAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    How much thrust would this engine give if both the throttle and thrust limtier was max at the current velocity, and at the given atmospheric pressure.  Use a pressure of 0.0 for vacuum, and 1.0 for sea level (on Kerbin) (or more than 1 for thicker atmospheres like on Eve). Note that this will read zero if the engine is currently disabled.
    (Pressure must be greater than or equal to zero.  If you pass in a
    negative value, it will be treated as if you had given a zero instead.)

.. attribute:: Engine:THRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    How much thrust is this engine giving at this very moment.

.. _engine_AVAILABLETHRUST:

.. attribute:: Engine:AVAILABLETHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust would this engine give if the throttle was max at its current thrust limit setting and atmospheric pressure and velocity conditions. Note that this will read zero if the engine is currently disabled.

.. _engine_AVAILABLETHRUSTAT:

.. method:: Engine:AVAILABLETHRUSTAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust would this engine give if the throttle was max at its current thrust limit setting and velocity, but at a different atmospheric pressure you pass into it.  The pressure is measured in ATM's, meaning 0.0 is a vacuum, 1.0 is sea level at Kerbin.  Note that this will read zero if the engine is currently disabled.
    (Pressure must be greater than or equal to zero.  If you pass in a
    negative value, it will be treated as if you had given a zero instead.)

.. _engine_POSSIBLETHRUST:

.. attribute:: Engine:POSSIBLETHRUST

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust would this engine give if the throttle was max at its current thrust limit setting and atmospheric pressure and velocity conditions. This will give the correct value even if the engine is currently disabled.

.. _engine_POSSIBLETHRUSTAT:

.. method:: Engine:POSSIBLETHRUSTAT(pressure)

    :parameter pressure: atmospheric pressure (in standard Kerbin atmospheres)
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (kN)

    Taking into account the thrust limiter tweakable setting, how much thrust would this engine give if the throttle was max at its current thrust limit setting and velocity, but at a different atmospheric pressure you pass into it.  The pressure is measured in ATM's, meaning 0.0 is a vacuum, 1.0 is sea level at Kerbin.  This will give the correct value even if the engine is currently disabled.
    (Pressure must be greater than or equal to zero.  If you pass in a
    negative value, it will be treated as if you had given a zero instead.)

    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (units/s)

    How much fuel volume would this engine consume at standard pressure and velocity if the throttle was max at 1.0, and the thrust limiter was max at 100%.  Note this might not be the engine's actual max fuel flow it could have under other air pressure conditions.  Some jet engines have a very different fuel consumption depending on how fast they are currently being rammed through the air.
    
.. attribute:: Engine:MASSFLOW

    :access: Get only
    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>` (Mg/s)

    How much fuel mass is this engine consuming at this very moment.

.. attribute:: Engine:MAXMASSFLOW

    :type: :ref:`scalar <scalar>`

    `Specific impulse <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Specific_impulse>`_ at the given atmospheric pressure.  Use a pressure of 0 for vacuum, and 1 for sea level (on Kerbin).
    (Pressure must be greater than or equal to zero.  If you pass in a
