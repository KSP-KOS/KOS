Body
====

This is any sort of planet or moon. To get a variable referring to a Body, you can do this::

    // "name" is the name of the body,
    // like "Mun" for example.
    SET MY_VAR TO BODY("name").

Also, all bodies have hard-coded variable names as well. You can use the variable ``Mun`` to mean the same thing as ``BODY("Mun")``.

.. note::
    .. versionchanged:: 0.13
        A Celestial Body is now also an :ref:`Orbitable <orbitable>`, and can use all the terms described for these objects too.

Predefined Celestial Bodies
---------------------------

All of the main celestial bodies in the game are reserved variable names. The following two lines do the exactly the same thing::

    SET the_mun TO Mun.
    SET the_mun TO Body("Mun").

* Sun
* Moho
* Eve
    * Gilly
* Kerbin
    * Mun
    * Minmus
* Duna
    * Ike
* Jool
    * Laythe
    * Vall
    * Tylo
    * Bop
    * Pol
* Eeloo

.. attribute:: Body:NAME

    The name of the body. Example: "Mun".

.. attribute:: Body:DESCRIPTION

    Longer description of the body, often just a duplicate of the name.

.. attribute:: Body:MASS

    The mass of the body in kilograms.

.. attribute:: Body:ALTITUDE

    The altitude of this body above the sea level surface of its parent body. I.e. the altitude of Mun above Kerbin.

.. attribute:: Body:ROTATIONPERIOD

    The length of the body's day in seconds. I.e. how long it takes for it to make one rotation.

.. attribute:: Body:RADIUS

    The radius from the body's center to its sea level.

.. attribute:: Body:MU

    The `Gravitational Parameter`_ of the body.

.. _Gravitational Parameter: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gravitational_parameter

.. attribute:: Body:ATM

    A variable that describes the atmosphere of this body.

.. attribute:: Body:ANGULARVEL

    Despite the name, this is technically not a velocity. It only tells you the axis of rotation, not the speed of rotation around that axis.
