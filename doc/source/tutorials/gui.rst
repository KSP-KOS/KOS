Creating Reusable GUI Elements
==============================

In this tutorial, we describe how to make a TabWidget that can be reused as a general-purpose widget.

The End Result
--------------

Starting from the end - how the user would like to *use* the TabWidget - is a good way to drive good
encapsulation and to avoid forcing implementation details upon the end user.

You should have an image of what the final result will look like, and a feel for how it would be used.
If you're reproducing concepts that already exist, you can use existing art as a guide. Here, we just
cheat and show a picture of the end result:

    :width: 100%

Now, from the coding side, how would we like to *use* our TabWidget?

1. "Import" the functionality into our script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The implementation is all contained in the single "TabWidget" directory. This allows us to easily
share the implementation with multiple KSP installs, and with others online::

    RUNONCEPATH("TabWidget/tabwidget").

2. Create a GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our TabWidget should be usable in any context, but in this example, we just create it at the top-level.
The AddTabWidget function should however accept any VBOX as the parameter::

    LOCAL my_gui IS GUI(500).
    LOCAL tabwidget IS AddTabWidget(my_gui).

3. Add tabs
^^^^^^^^^^^

We will want a function that adds a tab with a title on it, and returns a box into which we can
put whatever widgets we want::

    LOCAL page IS AddTab(tabwidget,"One").
    page:ADDLABEL("This is page 1").
    page:ADDLABEL("Put stuff here!").

    LOCAL page IS AddTab(tabwidget,"Two").
    page:ADDLABEL("This is page 2").
    page:ADDLABEL("Put more stuff here!").

    LOCAL page IS AddTab(tabwidget,"Three").
    page:ADDLABEL("This is page 3").
    page:ADDLABEL("Put even stuff here!").

4. Choose tab programmatically
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes we might want a tab other than the first to be the one shown. For example, the first tab might
be for launching into orbit from the surface, but if the vessel reboots and finds itself in space, the
tab for setting up Maneuver Nodes might be a better default::

    ChooseTab(tabwidget,1).

5. Handling the widgets on the tabs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rest here is just boilerplate - we add a Close button to the top level, then show and run the GUI until
the user presses the Close button::

    LOCAL close IS my_gui:ADDBUTTON("Close").
    my_gui:SHOW().
    UNTIL close:PRESSED {
        // Handle processing of all the widgets on all the tabs.
        WAIT(0).
    }
    my_gui:HIDE().

The Implementation
------------------

We now move on to the implementation of this desired functionality. We put everything below in the "TabWidget/tabwidget.ks"
file, as suggested in the RUNONCEPATH above.

1. Creating the TabWidget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, we implement the required "AddTabWidget" function. This function takes any box as a parameter (eg. the top level GUI,
or one created by GUI:ADDVLAYOUT, GUI:ADDSCROLLBOX, etc.::

        DECLARE FUNCTION AddTabWidget
        {
                // Any box is allowed
                DECLARE PARAMETER box.

                // See if styles for the TabWidget components (tabs and panels) has
                // already been defined elsewhere. If not, define each one

                IF NOT box:GUI:SKIN:HAS("TabWidgetTab") {

                        // The style for tabs is like a button, but it should smoothly connect
                        // to the panel below it, especially if it is the current selected tab.

                        LOCAL style IS box:GUI:SKIN:ADD("TabWidgetTab",box:GUI:SKIN:BUTTON).

                        // Images are stored alongside the code.
                        SET style:BG TO "TabWidget/images/back".
                        SET style:ON:BG to "TabWidget/images/front".
                        // Tweak the style.
                        SET style:TEXTCOLOR TO RGBA(0.7,0.75,0.7,1).
                        SET style:HOVER:BG TO "".
                        SET style:HOVER_ON:BG TO "".
                        SET style:MARGIN:H TO 0.
                        SET style:MARGIN:BOTTOM TO 0.
                }
                IF NOT box:GUI:SKIN:HAS("TabWidgetPanel") {
                        LOCAL style IS box:GUI:SKIN:ADD("TabWidgetPanel",box:GUI:SKIN:WINDOW).
                        SET style:BG TO "TabWidget/images/panel".
                        SET style:PADDING:TOP to 0.
                }

                // Add a vlayout (in case the box is a HBOX, for example),
                // then add a hlayout for the tabs and a stack to hols all the panels.
                LOCAL vbox IS box:ADDVLAYOUT.
                LOCAL tabs IS vbox:ADDHLAYOUT.
                LOCAL panels IS vbox:ADDSTACK.

                // any other customization of tabs and panels goes here

                // Return the empty TabWidget.
                RETURN vbox.
        }

2. Images for the Tabs and Panels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The images are based on other elements to make them suit the style.

============================= =============== ======================
The tab when in front:        |fronttabimage| Based on Button normal state
The tab when in the back      |backtabimage|  Based on Button normal_on state
The panel below the tabs:     |paneltabimage| Based on the GUI window background
============================= =============== ======================

.. |fronttabimage| image:: /_images/tutorials/gui/front.png
.. |backtabimage| image:: /_images/tutorials/gui/back.png
.. |paneltabimage| image:: /_images/tutorials/gui/panel.png

Note that these images need to be in the "TabWidget/images" directory, as referred to in the code above.

3. Adding a Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, we implement the required "AddTab" function. This function takes a TabWidget created by the previous function
and adds another tab to the end with a given name. It returns a VBOX into which widgets for that page of the TabWidget
can be added.::

        DECLARE FUNCTION AddTab
        {
                DECLARE PARAMETER tabwidget. // (the vbox)
                DECLARE PARAMETER tabname. // title for the tab

                // Get back the two widgets we created in AddTabWidget
                LOCAL hboxes IS tabwidget:WIDGETS.
                LOCAL tabs IS hboxes[0]. // the HLAYOUT
                LOCAL panels IS hboxes[1]. // the STACK

                // Add another panel, style it correctly
                LOCAL panel IS panels:ADDVBOX.
                SET panel:STYLE TO panel:GUI:SKIN:GET("TabWidgetPanel").

                // Add another tab, style it correctly
                LOCAL tab IS tabs:ADDBUTTON(tabname).
                SET tab:STYLE TO tab:GUI:SKIN:GET("TabWidgetTab").

                // Set the tab button to be exclusive - when
                // one tab goes up, the others go down.
                SET tab:TOGGLE TO true.
                SET tab:EXCLUSIVE TO true.

                // If this is the first tab, make it start already shown (make the tab presssed)
                // Otherwise, we hide it (even though the STACK will only show the first anyway,
                // but by keeping everything "correct", we can be a little more efficient later.
                IF panels:WIDGETS:LENGTH = 1 {
                        SET tab:PRESSED TO true.
                        panels:SHOWONLY(panel).
                } else {
                        panel:HIDE().
                }
                

                // Add the tab and its corresponding panel to global variables,
                // in order to handle interaction later.
                TabWidget_alltabs:ADD(tab).
                TabWidget_allpanels:ADD(panel).

                RETURN panel.
        }

        // Global variables to allow interaction to be done later.
        GLOBAL TabWidget_alltabs TO LIST().
        GLOBAL TabWidget_allpanels TO LIST().

3. Adding a Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We want to be able to choose a specific tab to be shown, so we add a simple function to encapsulate
that::

        DECLARE FUNCTION ChooseTab
        {
                DECLARE PARAMETER tabwidget. // The tab
                DECLARE PARAMETER tabnum. // Which tab to choose (0 is first)
                // Find the tabs hlayout - is is the first of the two we added
                LOCAL hboxes IS tabwidget:WIDGETS.
                LOCAL tabs IS hboxes[0].
                // Find the tab, and set it to be pressed
                SET tabs:WIDGETS[tabnum]:PRESSED TO true.
        }

4. Running the TabWidget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rather than ask the user to repeatedly call a function to run the TabWidget (which would also be fine,
but not in our original design), we instead use a "trick" to watch the tab buttons to see if they get
pressed, and raise the corresponding tab if they are::

        WHEN True THEN {
                FROM { LOCAL x IS 0.} UNTIL x >= TabWidget_alltabs:LENGTH STEP { SET x TO x+1.} DO
                {
                        // Earlier, we were careful to hide the panels that were not the current
                        // one when they were added, so we can test if the panel is VISIBLE
                        // to avoid the more expensive call to SHOWONLY every frame.
                        IF TabWidget_alltabs[x]:PRESSED AND NOT TabWidget_allpanels[x]:VISIBLE {
                                TabWidget_allpanels[x]:parent:showonly(TabWidget_allpanels[x]).
                        }
                }
                PRESERVE.
        }

By using "WHEN True" and "PRESERVE", this code effectively runs once every frame. It looks at all the tabs that
have been created (even in multiple TabWidgets), and calls SHOWONLY on the STACK, giving it the panel that
corresponds to the tab that was pressed. Since this code is executed every frame (but only once, since RUNONCEPATH
ensures this WHEN statement only starts once), we are careful to do the minimum amount of processing necessary.

5. Testing with Communication Delay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When playing with communication delay enabled (eg. with RemoteTech), you will want to ensure that the GUI is still
usable with interaction delays, and ensure it does not cause continuous communication on the link. For example, if
you constantly show a label with very high precision decimal, it will probably be updating the label continuously,
which would mean the communication delay icon is constantly shown. We can test our GUI without flying to Jool by
artificially adding extra delay, and testing on the launch pad::

    ...
    SET my_gui:EXTRADELAY TO 2.
    ...

The widget continues to work perfectly. Even if the user rapidly changes tab, the pages change as expected, though
of course delayed.
