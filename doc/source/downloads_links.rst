    Useful resources off-site for kOS:

Obtaining kOS itself
---------------------

    The kOS mod can be obtained a number of ways:

    - `Use CKAN <https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases>`__.  The Comprehensive Kerbal
      Archive Network.  If you install the CKAN program, it can manage your mods for you
      and check for updates whenever you run it.  kOS sends update information to CKAN
      so kOS updates should appear in your CKAN manager tool as soon as they're released.
    - `Download from github directly <https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/releases>`__
      Github is where development of the mod occurs, and new releases will apear there
      first, without delays, and its where old obsolete releases can be found, if you
      need one for use with an older version of KSP.
    - `Use KerbalStuff <https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/86/kOS:%20Scriptable%20Autopilot%20System>`__
      Kerbalstuff is a community supported Kerbal Space Program mod hosting site that behaves
      much like Curse, but without Curse's embedded advertisements all over the webpage.
    - `Download from Curse <http://www.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/220265-kos-scriptable-autopilot-system>`__
      Love it or Loathe it, Curse is the official place SQUAD points people to for KSP addons, so we
      make it available there too.

Show and Tell, and Tutorials
----------------------------

    There are a number of people who have created helpful tutorials for kOS, and
    others who've created show and tell videos showing the nifty things they've done with kOS.
    If you'd like to have your video added to this section please contact the authors of
    over on github at `https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS <https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS>`__.

    Note that there is category overlap as often a showoff video is also a sort of tutorial too.

**Tutorials**

    - `Seth Persigehl's Tutorial playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpK8nolWr1rghS5cOEOL-JQ33h4CgPAP>`__

**Show and Tell**

    - `Steven Mading's user scripts playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdXwd2JlyAvqamZN_jfcxUc29Q6Kzxqmb>`__
      Some of these are very old and out of date, going back as far as kOS version 0.65.  The actual code
      used may have to be tweaked a bit to work with recent kOS releases.
    - `Parasite's first docking script, reddit post <http://www.reddit.com/r/Kos/comments/2w3sq5/first_working_docking_script_info_in_comments/>`__

**Past Teasers**

    - `Steven Mading's Developer teasers playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdXwd2JlyAvo_pH1tS3P7elVTYjvmIh-m>`__ 
      (Note these are teasers that were created just before new features were first released, to
      show off what was (at the time) new content that hadn't been public yet.  They also can 
      constitute a tutorial of sorts to show how some of the features work.)
