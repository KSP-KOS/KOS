Obtaining kOS itself
---------------------

    The kOS mod can be obtained a number of ways:

    - `Use CKAN <https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases>`__.  The Comprehensive Kerbal
      Archive Network.  If you install the CKAN program, it can manage your mods for you
      and check for updates whenever you run it.  kOS sends update information to CKAN
      so kOS updates should appear in your CKAN manager tool as soon as they're released.
    - `Download from github directly <https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/releases>`__
      Github is where development of the mod occurs, and new releases will apear there
      first, without delays, and its where old obsolete releases can be found, if you
      need one for use with an older version of KSP.
    - `Use SpaceDock <https://spacedock.info/mod/60/kOS:%20Scriptable%20Autopilot%20System>`__
      SpaceDock is a community supported Kerbal Space Program mod hosting site that behaves
      much like Curse, but without Curse's embedded advertisements all over the webpage.  It
      was designed as the successor to KerbalStuff.
    - `Download from Curse <https://www.curseforge.com/kerbal/ksp-mods/kos-scriptable-autopilot-system>`__
      Love it or Loathe it, Curse is the official place SQUAD points people to for KSP addons, so we
      make it available there too.

Change Log
----------

    - `Change Log <https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`__ on Github.

Online Community
----------------

There are two good places to go for help and sharing of ideas with other
users of kOS, and the developers of the mod frequent those locations too:

- `/r/kos on reddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/kos>`__
- `On Kerbal Space Program's forum <https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/165628-*/>`__

Of these two locations, the Reddit one tends to be more active because it
allows multiple sub-threads about kOS.  On the Kerbal Space Program
forum, all kOS talk occurs in one uniform thread, which is a little less
useful for discussing different ideas and different scripts.

Show and Tell, and Tutorials
----------------------------

    There are a number of people who have created helpful tutorials for kOS, and
    others who've created show and tell videos showing the nifty things they've done with kOS.
    If you'd like to have your video added to this section please contact the authors of
    over on github at `https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS <https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS>`__.

    Note that there is category overlap as often a showoff video is also a sort of tutorial too.

**Tutorials**

    - `Seth Persigehl's Tutorial playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEpK8nolWr1rghS5cOEOL-JQ33h4CgPAP>`__
    - `CheersKevinGames <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNlAME5eU3o&list=PLb6UbFXBdbCrvdXVgY_3jp5swtvW24fYv>`__
      A channel devoted to a career mode game played with kOS from day 1, in which no
      Kerbals themselves are allowed to touch the controls.  All piloting is performed
      by kOS programs.  Also works as a good deep explanation of many topics to new
      users of the mod, and people new to programming in general.

**Show and Tell**

    - `Ozin's amazing drone video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4SytD3xR0k>`__
    - `Dunbaratu's user scripts playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdXwd2JlyAvqamZN_jfcxUc29Q6Kzxqmb>`__
    - `Seth Persihel's SpaceX-style first stage return in FAR <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqqQy8cIVFY>`__
    - `NearlyEnoughDice demonstrating a leg leveller <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh9RrVTQ6xw>`__
    - `Allmhuran's Mechs with scripted AI <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZoyWcUNAZY>`__
    - `Scripted airplane takeoff, waypoint seek, and landing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA4DdVGuBxc>`__
      Some of these are very old and out of date, going back as far as kOS version 0.65.  The actual code
      used may have to be tweaked a bit to work with recent kOS releases.
