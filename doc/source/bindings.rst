Catalog of Bound Variable Names
===============================

This is the list of special reserved keyword variable names that kOS
will interpret
to mean something special. If they are used as normal variable names by
your kOS script
program they may not work. Understanding them and their meaning is
crucial to creating
effective kOS scripts.

NAMED VESSELS AND BODIES
------------------------

SHIP:

| **Variable name**: SHIP
| **Gettable**: yes
| **Settable**: no
| **Type**: `Vessel <structures/vessels/vessel.html>`__
| **Description**: Whichever vessel happens to be the one containing the CPU part that is running this Kerboscript code at the moment. This is the `CPU Vessel <general/cpu_vessel.html>`__.
 
TARGET:

| **Variable Name**: TARGET
| **Gettable**: yes
| **Settable**: yes
| **Type**: `Vessel <structures/vessels/vessel.html>`__ or `Body <structures/celestial_bodies/body.html>`__
| **Description**: Whichever `Orbitable <structures/orbits/orbitable.html>`__ object happens to be the one selected as the current KSP target. If set to a string, it will assume the string is the name of a vessel being targeted and set it to a vessel by that name. For best results set it to Body("some name") or Vessel("some name") explicitly.  This will throw an exception if called from a vessel other than the active vessel, as limitations in how KSP sets the
target vessel limit the implementation to working with only the active vessel.

HASTARGET:

| **Variable Name**: TARGET
| **Gettable**: yes
| **Settable**: no
| **Type**: boolean
| **Description**: Will return true if the ship has a target selected.  This will always return false
when not on the active vessel, due to limitations in how KSP sets the target vessel.

Alias shortcuts for SHIP fields
-------------------------------

The following are all alias shortcuts for accessing the fields of the
SHIP vessel.
To see their definition, please consult the
`Vessel <structures/vessels/vessel.html>`__

Constants (pi, e, etc)
----------------------

Get-only.

The variable ``constant`` provides a way to access a few
:ref:`basic math and physics constants <constants>`, such as Pi, Euler's
number, and so on.

Example::

    print "Kerbin's circumference: " + (2*constant:pi*Kerbin:radius) + "meters.".

The full list is here: :ref:`constants page <constants>`.

Terminal
--------

Get-only. ``terminal`` returns a :struct:`terminal` structure describing
the attributes of the current terminal screen associated with the
CPU this script is running on.

Core
----

Get-only. ``core`` returns a :struct:`core` structure referring to the CPU you
are running on.

Stage
-----

Get-only. ``stage`` returns a :struct:`stage` structure used to count resources
in the current stage.  Not to be confused with the COMMAND stage
which triggers the next stage.

NextNode
--------

Get-only. ``nextnode`` returns the next planned maneuver :struct:`node` in the SHIP's flight plan.  Will throw an exception if
no node exists, or if called on a ship that is not the active vessel.

HasNode
--------

Get-only. ``hasnode`` returns true if there is a planned maneuver :struct:`node` in the SHIP's flight plan.  This will always return
false for the non-active vessel, as access to maneuver nodes is limited to the active vessel.

Resource Types
--------------

Any time there is a resource on the ship it can be queried. The
resources are the values that appear when you click on the upper-right
corner of the screen in the KSP window. |Resources|

::

    LIQUIDFUEL
    OXIDIZER
    ELECTRICCHARGE
    MONOPROPELLANT
    INTAKEAIR
    SOLIDFUEL

All of the above resources can be queried using either the prefix SHIP
or STAGE, depending on whether you are trying to query how much is left
in the current stage or the entire ship:

How much liquid fuel is left in the entire ship:

::

    PRINT "There is " + SHIP:LIQUIDFUEL + " liquid fuel on the ship.".

How much liquid fuel is left in just the current stage:

::

    PRINT "There is " + STAGE:LIQUIDFUEL + " liquid fuel in this stage.".

How much liquid fuel is left in the target vessel:

::

    PRINT "There is " + TARGET:LIQUIDFUEL + " liquid fuel in the target ship.".

Any other resources that you have added using other mods should be
query-able this way, provided that you spell
the term exactly as it appears in the resources window.

You can also get a list of all resources, either in SHIP: or STAGE: with the :RESOURCES suffix. 

.. |Resources| image:: /_images/reference/bindings/resources.png

ALT ALIAS
---------

The special variable `ALT <structures/vessels/alt.html>`__ gives you
access to a few altitude predictions:

ALT:APOAPSIS 

ALT:PERIAPSIS

ALT:RADAR

Further details are found on the `ALT page <structures/vessels/alt.html>`__ .


ETA ALIAS
---------

The special variable `ETA <structures/vessels/eta.html>`__ gives you
access to a few time predictions:

ETA:APOAPSIS 

ETA:PERIAPSIS

ETA:TRANSITION

Further details are found on the `ETA page <structures/vessels/eta.html>`__ .

ENCOUNTER
---------

The orbit patch describing the next encounter with a body the current
vessel will enter. If there is no such encounter coming, it will return
the special string "None".  If there is an encounter coming, it will
return an object :ref:`of type Orbit <orbit>`.  (i.e. to obtain the name
of the planet the encounter is with, you can do:
``print ENCOUNTER:BODY:NAME.``, for example.).

BOOLEAN TOGGLE FIELDS:
----------------------

These are variables that behave like boolean flags. They can be True or
False, and can be set or toggled
using the "ON" and "OFF" and "TOGGLE" commands.
Many of these are for action group flags.
**NOTE ABOUT ACTION GROUP FLAGS:** If the boolean flag is for an action
group, be aware that each time the
user presses the action group keypress, it *toggles* the action group,
so you might need to check for both
the change in state from false to true AND the change in state from true
to false to see if the key was hit.

============== ==========   ========= ===============
Variable Name  Can Read     Can Set   Description
============== ==========   ========= ===============
SAS            yes          yes       (Same as "SAS" indicator on the navball.)
RCS            yes          yes       (Same as "RCS" indicator on the navball.)
GEAR           yes          yes       Is the GEAR enabled right now? (Note, KSP does some strange things with this flag, like needing to hit it twice the first time).
LEGS           yes          yes       Are the landing LEGS extended? (as opposed to GEAR which is for the wheels of a plane.)
CHUTES         yes          yes       Are the parachutes extended? (Treats all parachutes as one single unit. Does not activate them individually.)
LIGHTS         yes          yes       Are the lights on? (like the "U" key in manual flight.)
PANELS         yes          yes       Are the solar panels extended? (Treats all solar panels as one single unit. Does not activate them individually.)
BRAKES         yes          yes       Are the brakes on?
ABORT          yes          yes       Abort Action Group.

AG10           yes          yes       Action Group 10.
AGn            yes          yes       If you have the Action Groups Extended mod installed, you can access its groups the same way, i.e. AG11, AG12, AG13, etc.
============== ==========   ========= ===============

Flight Control
--------------

There are bound variables used in controlling the flight of a ship, which
can be found at the following links:

If you want to let kOS do a lot of the work of aligning to a desired
heading for you, use `Cooked Control <commands/flight/cooked.html>`__.

If you want your script to manipulate the controls directly (as in "set
yaw axis halfway left for a few seconds (using the 'A' key)", then
use `Raw Control <commands/flight/raw.html>`__.

If you want to be able to READ what the player is attempting to do
while your script is running, and perhaps respond to it, then use
`Reading the Pilot's Control settings (i.e reading what the manual input is attempting) <commands/flight/pilot.html>`__ 
(By default your script will override manual piloting attempts, but
you can read what the pilot's controls are set at and make your
autopilot take them under advisement - sort of like how a
fly-by-wire plane works.)


Controls that must be used with LOCK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    THROTTLE            // Lock to a decimal value between 0 and 1.
    STEERING            // Lock to a direction, either a Vector or a Direction.
    WHEELTHROTTLE       // Separate throttle for wheels
    WHEELSTEERING       // Separate steering system for wheels

Time
----

`Time <structures/misc/time.html>`__ is the simulated amount of time that passed since the beginning of the game's universe epoch. (A brand new campaign that just started begins at TIME zero.)

TIME is a useful system variable for calculating the passage of time
between taking
physical measurements (i.e. to calculate how fast a phenomenon is
changing in a loop).
It returns the KSP *simulated* time, rather than the actual realtime
sitting in the
chair playing the game. If everything is running smoothly on a fast
computer, one
second of simulated time will match one second of real time, but if
anything is
causing the game to stutter or lag a bit, then the simulated time will
be a bit
slower than the real time. For any script program trying to calculate
physical
properties of the KSP universe, the time that matters is the simulated
time, which
is what TIME returns.

It's important to be aware of the `frozen update
nature <general/CPU_hardware.html#FROZEN>`__ of the kOS
computer when reading TIME.

System Variables
----------------

This section is about variables that describe the things that are slightly
outside the simulated universe of the game and are more about
the game's user interface or the kOS mod itself.  They represent things
that slightly "break the fourth wall" and let your script access
something entirely outside the in-character experience.

::

    PRINT VERSION.            // Returns operating system version number. e.g. 0.8.6
    PRINT VERSION:MAJOR.      // Returns major version number. e.g. 0
    PRINT VERSION:MINOR.      // Returns minor version number. e.g. 8
    PRINT VERSION:BUILD.      // Returns build version number. e.g. 6
    PRINT SESSIONTIME.        // Returns amount of time, in seconds, from vessel load.

NOTE the following important difference:

SESSIONTIME is the time since the last time this vessel was loaded from
on-rails into full physics.

TIME is the time since the entire saved game campaign started, in the
kerbal universe's time. i.e. TIME = 0 means a brand new campaign was
just started.

KUNIVERSE
~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Kuniverse <kuniverse>` is a structure that contains many settings that
break the fourth wall a little bit and control the game simulation directly.
The eventual goal is probably to move many of the variables you see listed
below into ``kuniverse``.

Config
~~~~~~

CONFIG is a special variable name that refers to the configuration
settings for the kOS mod, and can be used to set or get various
options.

`CONFIG has its own page <structures/misc/config.html>`__ for further
details.

WARP and WARPMODE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time warp can be controlled with the variables
WARP and WARPMODE.  See :ref:`WARP <warp>`

MAPVIEW
~~~~~~~

A boolean that is both gettable and settable.

If you query MAPVIEW, it's true if on the map screen, and false if on the flight view screen.  If you SET MAPVIEW, you can cause the game to switch between mapview and flight view or visa versa.

LOADDISTANCE
~~~~~~~~~~~~

LOADDISTANCE sets the distance from the active vessel at
which vessels get removed from the full physics engine and put
on-rails, or visa versa.  Note that as of KSP 1.0 the stock game
supports multiple different load distance settings for different
situations such that the value changes depending on where you are.
But kOS does not support this at the moment so in kOS if you set
the LOADDISTANCE, you are setting it to the same value
universally for all situations.

.. _solarprimevector:

SOLARPRIMEVECTOR
----------------

Gives the Prime Meridian :struct:`Vector` for the Solar System itself, in
current Ship-Raw XYZ coordinates.

Both the :attr:`Orbit:LONGITUDEOFASCENDINGNODE` orbit suffix and the
:attr:`Body:ROTATIONANGLE` body suffix are expressed in terms of
degree offsets from this *Prime Meridian Reference Vector*.

What is the Solar Prime Reference Vector?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The solar prime vector is an arbitrary vector in space used to measure
some orbital parameters that are supposed to remain fixed to space
regardless of how the planets underneath the orbit rotate, or where the
Sun is.  In a sense it can be thought of as the celestial "prime
meridian" of the entire solar system, rather than the "prime meridian" of
any one particular rotating planet or moon.

In a hypothetical Earthling's solar system our Kerbal scientists have
hypothesized may exist in a galaxy far away, Earthbound astronomers use
a reference they called the
`First Point of Aries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Point_of_Aries>`__,
for this purpose.

For Kerbals, it refers to a more arbitrary line in space, pointing at a fixed
point in the firmament, also known as the "skybox".

Addons
------

Get-only.  ``addons`` is a special variable used to access various extensions
to kOS that are designed to support the features introduced by some other mods.  More info can be found on the :ref:`addons <addons>` page.

Colors
------

There are several bound variables associated with :ref:`hardcoded colors <colors>` such as WHITE, BLACK, RED, etc.  See the linked page for the full list.
