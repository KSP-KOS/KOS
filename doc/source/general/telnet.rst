Telnet is an old network protocol designed in the early days of the Internet, long
before World Wide Web.  Its purpose was (is) to allow you to get access to the
remote command line interfaces of distant server computers, acting as if the 
keyboard and computer screen in front of you was a terminal hooked up to a distant
computer.  kOS uses this protocol to let you
**access the kOS terminal from a program outside of Kerbal Space Program**.

There are freely available programs you can use as the telnet client to
behave like terminal windows outside of the KSP window.  A list of them appears below
in the section called `Telnet clients`_.

There are some *security implications* of enabling the kOS telnet server, and the
first time you turn it on you will see some warning messages to this effect.
If you want to read further about these concerns before deciding to turn it
on, see the section called "`Security`_" at the bottom of this page.

Telnet clients
--------------

The telnet server for kOS requires the use of a
`telnet client program <http://www.telnet.org/htm/applications.htm>`_. We
recommend the following programs, although you can use others:

For Windows
  We recommend `Putty <http://www.putty.org/>`_, the free terminal emulator
  for Windows, although any good terminal emulator should do the job, 
  provided it is capable of operating in an "XTERM - compatible" mode.

For Mac
  You shouldn't have to install anything.  There should be a telnet client
  already installed, which you can access by opening up your command terminal,
  and then running it as a command-line tool.  To see how to use it, read
  below in the section titled "`HOWTO: Command-line client`_".  The built-in
  Terminal.app for OSX understands the XTERM command sequences that kOS uses
  and in fact identifies itself as a type of XTERM when used with a telnet
  client.

For Linux
  You shouldn't have to install anything.  There should be a telnet client
  already installed, and an xterm program already installed in most any Linux
  distribution.  Open an xterm window, and in that window type the telnet 
  command, as described by the section titled "`HOWTO: Command-line client`_"

Using it
--------

1. Turn on the telnet server by going into the app control panel and clicking
   on the green circle next to the word "Telnet".  Alternatively, you can
   issue the command::

     SET CONFIG:TELNET TO TRUE.

   from any terminal window in kOS.

2. The very first time you do this, you will get a warning message, as per
   `SQUAD's rule number 5 about mods that run network services <http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87843-Forum-Rules-Add-on-Posting-Rules-August-21st-2014>`_. 
   After accepting and clicking "yes", the server will be running on loopback 
   127.0.0.1 (if you want to make it run on the non-loopback address, you will
   get a secondary warning message about that too.

3. Launch your telnet client (there is a list of telnet clients that are known
   to work listed below.

4. When you first log in to the server you should see the "Welcome menu", which is a 
   screen looking like this::

      Terminal: type = XTERM, size = 80x24
      ________________________________________________________________________________

      Choose a CPU to attach to by typing a selection number and pressing
      return/enter. Or enter [Q] to quit terminal server.
      
      (After attaching, you can (D)etach and return to this menu by pressing Control-D
      as the first character on a new command line.)
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      >_


   Or, if there are no CPU's within range, it will look like this::

      Terminal: type = XTERM, size = 80x24
      ________________________________________________________________________________
                    Menu GUI   Other

                                            <NONE>

   At any moment you can force a redraw of the menu by entering any gibberish non-
   numeric data and hitting enter.

   This menu should match 1:1 with the list of CPU's you see on the kOS applauncher
   control panel.

     :width: 75 %

     The welcome menu, shown here in a Mac OSX terminal.

5. **Pick a CPU.**  Pick one of the CPU's listed by typing its number and hitting enter.

6. Your telnet is now connected to the server and should behave as the terminal for
   that CPU.  You can type commands and do what you like, the same as if you had been
   directly on its window.

7. See the section labeled `Special Keys`_ to see how to use the keyboard from your
   telnet client.

8. It is possible to have multiple terminals hooked up to the same in-game CPU.  They
   will all behave as clones of each other, each being an equal "first citizen". 
   (For example a pair of people could execute the "stage." command by having one
   of them type "st", then the other types "age", followed by the first person
   typing "." and the return key.)  All the keyboards and all the screens are
   slaved together to be equal.  You can view the in-game gui terminal while 
   somebody is typing on a telnet temrinal.

9. In order to make the terminals act as clones of each other, the game will attempt
   to keep them all the same size.  If you resize your telnet client window, it should
   cause the in-game window to change size to match.  (If your terminal type is XTERM,
   then the same thing works in reverse.  If it's VT100 then it doesn't.)

.. warning::
  Certain implementations of the xterm terminal emulation and the telnet client have
  created a strange unending cascade of terminal resizes when you have two different
  telnet clients connected to the same GUI terminal and one of them is dragged to a
  new size.  Because some implementations don't wait until they're done resizing to
  report their new size through telnet and instead report their intermediate sizes as
  they are being stretched, the attempt to keep them the same size causes them to
  effectively "argue" back and forth with each other, constantly changing each
  other's size.   If you experience this problem (your terminal window will be
  flipping back and forth between two different sizes, resizing itself over and over
  again in a neverending loop), you can try to get out of it by issuing a hardcoded
  command to set the terminal size, such as::

    SET TERMINAL:WIDTH TO 50.

  Doing this should force all the connected telnet XTERM windows to stop arguing with
  each other about what the size is, and get them synced up again.

10. At any time you may disconnect your telnet client from the terminal by hitting
    control-D as the first character of a new line.  This will bring you back to
    the telnet welcome menu again.

Special Keys
------------

The following keys have special meaning in the telnet session:

Control-L
  **Force refresh** Pressing Control-L forces the kOS telnet server to
  redraw your whole screen for you from scratch.  This is useful if
  you encounter strange line noise, interrupted messages, or for
  just any occasion where you suspect the screen isn't being drawn
  correctly.  Pressing control-L will ensure your display gets
  fully re-synced with what's in the buffer in memory for the
  terminal.

Control-C
  **interrupt process** This is the same meaning as control-C in the normal
  GUI terminal - it breaks the program execution.  The reason it gets a special
  mention here is that it also causes a flush of all the pending input you may
  have typed ahead in the queue.  If you've been typing blindly ahead, and then
  hit Control-C, it will erase your typed-ahead keys as it sends the interrupt
  to the server.  This is deliberate, and typical practice for an interrupt
  character sent over a remote shell setting.

Control-D
  **detach** If you hit control-D as the first character of a new line, it will
  detach your telnet session from the CPU and return you to the welcome menu.

Cursor Keys
  **should be mapped** If your terminal has identified itself as one of the known
  types that kOS supports, it should understand your arrow keys as arrow keys.
  If you see the text "[A" when you type up-arrow, or "[C" when you type right-arrow,
  this is a clue that kOS didn't recognize your terminal type properly.

Other Keys
  **might be mapped** Some keys like the Del (to the right), Home, and End keys are
  often not mapped correctly in some terminal emulator programs.  If you have 
  trouble using HOME and END, you can try Control-A and Control-E as alternates for
  Home and End.

Control-A
  **home** This is an alternate way to press the "home" key, just in case your terminal
  emulation isn't sending the officially understood terminal code for it.

Control-E
  **end** This is an alternate way to press the "end" key, just in case your terminal
  emulation isn't sending the officially understood terminal code for it.

Control-H
  **backspace** This is an alternate way to press the "backspace" key, just
  in case your terminal emulation isn't sending the officially understood
  terminal code for it.

Control-M
  **Return** This is an alternate way to press the "enter" or "return" key,
  just in case your terminal emulation isn't sending the officially understood
  terminal code for it.

HOWTO: Putty client
-------------------

(These instructions assume you use the default kOS Telnet server settings, of
the loopback address 127.0.0.1, and port number 5410.  If you've changed those
settings then alter the numbers you see here accordingly.)

1. Run KSP, and get it into a scene where there exists a vessel
   with at least one kOS CPU loaded into it.
2. Run Putty.
3. On the first dialog you see, click the *Telnet* radio-button selection.
4. Type in the number 127.0.0.1 in the large blank above the radio
   buttons that is labeled *"Host Name (or IP address)"*.
5. Type in the number 5410 in the smaller blank to the right of it
   that is labeled *"Port"*.
6. At the bottom of the screen, select the radio button labeled
   *"Never"* under *"Close window on exit"*.
7. Click the *Open* button to connect to the server.

(You can also save these settings under a name for later re-use.)

Step 6 is important.  Without it, Putty would just make the window disappear any
time there's a problem, making it very hard to diagnose because you can't see what
message the server was sending back to you just before the window went away.

(These instructions assume you use the default kOS Telnet server settings, of

settings then alter the numbers you see here accordingly.)

1.  Run KSP, and get it into a scene where there exists a vessel with
    at least one 
    kOS CPU loaded into it.
2.  Open a command shell window that either *IS* xterm, or emulates xterm.  For
    OSX, the default command shell should work fine.  For Linux, you should
    actually have the xterm program itself installed that you can use.
3.  At the shell prompt in that window, enter the command::

      telnet 127.0.0.1 5410

HOWTO: Other client
-------------------

1. Set the IP address to 127.0.0.1 using whatever means the program has for it.
2. Set the port number to 5410 using whatever means the program has for it.
3. Set the terminal to XTERM emulation mode if it has it, or VT100 mode as a
   less good, but still perhaps workable option.
4. Run the terminal.

Security
--------

The telnet protocol performs no encryption of its data, and as such any attempt
at securing the system using a name/password combination would have been
utterly pointless.  Rather than provide a false sense of security that's not
really there, we decided to make it obvious that there's no security by not
even implementing a name and password for connecting to the kOS telnet server.

The purpose is to make it clear that if you want to open up your kOS telnet
server, you need to be careful about how you do it.

The default settings that kOS ships with restricts your kOS telnet server to
only operating on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) so that you won't accidentally
open anything up to the public without thinking about it and making a conscious
decision to do so.  If you don't know what that means, it means this:
Any server that runs on the magic special address 127.0.0.1, known as "loopback",
is incapable of taking connections from other computers besides itself.

In order to allow your kOS telnet server to take connections from other 
computers, you will typically need to do one of two things:

Either turn off the CONFIG:LOOPBACK option in your kOS install and then
restart your telnet server (turn it off and on again using the button on the 
control panel), or (much better), set up a remote ssh tunnel that will map
from your current machine's loopback address on the port number of your server to
some remote other computer you want to connect from, to a port on it.  The ssh 
tunnel is the preferred method, but describing how to set one up is beyond the
scope of this document.  You can read more
`For windows <http://realprogrammers.com/how_to/set_up_an_ssh_tunnel_with_putty.html>`_ or
`For UNIX (both Mac and Linux) <http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/set-up-ssh-tunneling-on-a-linux-unix-bsd-server-to-bypass-nat/>`_.

Example: Let's say you have a remote Unix machine you'd like to enable logins from,
from there and nowhere else.  You can forward from your own machine's 
127.0.0.1, port 5410, to the remote machine's, oh let's say 127.0.0.1, port 54100.
Then anyone on the remote machine could telnet to ITS 127.0.0.1, port 54100 and 
end up talking to your machine's port 5410 on its loopback address.

**Port forwarding**

If you opt to turn off the loopback-only mode on your kOS telnet server, then you
will probably also, if you have a typical home network setup, need to enable
port forwarding on your router if you want people from outside your house to 
connect to it.  (Again, think about the implications of doing so before you do it).
This is a topic beyond the scope of this document, but help can be found out on
the web for it.  Search for "port forward home router".  (It is probably also a
good idea to include the make & model number of your router device in your search
terms, to get a nicely narrowed result that's exactly what you need.)


**Why not ssh?**

The original plan for kOS was to include an ssh server
instead of a telnet server.  However this proved problematic as open source
solutions in C# for the server-side of ssh were hard to come by (there's several
for the client side only, and plenty of server-side code that's not in C#), and
implementing the entire server side of the ssh protocol from scratch is a
daunting task that would have taken too much time away from other development
of kOS.  (While implementing from scratch the server side of the older, simpler
telnet protocol, while still work, was more doable).

Homemade telnet clients
-----------------------

This section is only of interest to hobbyists making Kerbal console hardware rigs
and software developers trying to make interface mods that pretend to be
kOS terminals.  If you are neither of those two, then don't worry if this section
looks like gibberish to you.  It can be skipped.

**TELNET PROTOCOL**

If you wish to make your own homemade telnet client and connect it up to the 
kOS telnet server, the following is the required subset of the telnet protocol
that your telnet client must speak, and the terminal requirements it must
fulfill:

1. It must suppress local character echoing, and enter character-at-a-time mode,
   by implementing both the ECHO negotiation
   `described by RFC857 <http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc857.txt>`_, and 
   the SUPPRESS GO AHEAD negotiation
   `described by RFC858 <http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc858.txt>`_. These are
   used in the following way:  Your client must NOT ECHo (letting the server do it),
   and your client must suppress go-ahead messages (allowing real-time back-and-forth).
2. It must implement the underlying DO/DONT and WILL/WONT, and SB/SE infrastructure of
   the main `telnet RFC854 <http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc854.txt>`_.  It must
   send break (ctrl-C) as the IP interrupt process command (byte 255 followed by 244).
   kOS does not use much of the negotiations of the protocol mentioned on RFC854, other
   than those that are necessary to enable the other ones mentioned here.
3. It must implement the Terminal-Type option
   `described by RFC1091 <http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc1091.txt>`_.
   Furthermore, as of this writing, kOS only knows how to understand two terminal types,
   "XTERM", and "VT100".  If your terminal type is identified as anything else, kOS
   may deny your connection, or at the very least just not work right.  Even terminals
   that are capable of emulating XTERM or VT100 commands won't work right if they 
   don't identify themselves as XTERM or VT100.  kOS does not know how to guess what
   emulation mode to enter if it doesn't recognize your terminal type string.
4. It must implement the NAWS, Negotiate About Terminal Size option, as
   `described by RFC1073 <http://www.networksorcery.com/enp/rfc/rfc1073.txt>`_.
   kOS uses this to decide how to size its mental image of your terminal to match
   your terminal's real size.  Note that this negotiation is one-way.  Your client
   can use it to tell the server about its size, but the server can't use it to
   tell your client to change its size.  Instead if your client can respond to changing
   sizes at the behest of the server, it must do so through terminal escape code
   characters sent back to it on the stream, above the telnet protocol layer itself.
   (For example, if you identify as XTERM, you will be sent the XTERM escape code 
   pattern ESC [ 8 ; *height* ; *width* t, which is the XTERM escape code for setting
   the terminal size.)  This is because the telnet protocol was never written to
   accommodate the concept of server-initiated resizes.

Making a telnet client from scratch that actually follows protocol may be a complex
enough task that the smarter solution is to just use an existing telnet program, if
you are trying to create some sort of hardware rig.  These days a small cheap
mini-hardware implementation of Linux should be doable, and could include the
telnet client installed in it for very little storage cost.

**TERMINAL EMULATION**

As of right now, the terminal emulation of kOS only really supports XTERM
or VT100 well, however the infrastructure is in place to support modifications
to map to other terminal types.  If you want to try a hand at adding the
terminal emulation for a currently unsupported terminal, you'd do it
by subclassing the kOS.UserIO.TerminalUnicodeMapper class.  You can
look at kOS.UserIO.TerminalXtermMapper as a sample to see what you need
to do.

If you have a project where you want to just work with the terminal
codes already supported, then these are the subset you need to support:



*ASCII*
  The following terms should have their normal ASCII meaning:

0x08 (control-H)
  backspace key

0x0d (control-M)
  Return key.  On output it means go to left edge but don't go down a line.
  A typical eoln needs to occur using its ASCII standard of both a
  return character 0x0d AND a linefeed character 0x0a

0x0a (control-J)
  On output it means go to go down a line but don't go to the left edge
  A typical eoln needs to occur using its ASCII standard of both a 
  return character 0x0d AND a linefeed character 0x0a



**Terminal codes:** *The following terms should have their VT100/XTERM meaning*

Left-Arrow
  ESC [ D  *-- both on input and on output*

Right-Arrow
  ESC [ C  *-- both on input and on output*

Up-Arrow
  ESC [ A  *-- both on input and on output*

Down-Arrow
  ESC [ B  *-- both on input and on output*

Home-key
  ESC [ 1 ~  *-- input only*

End-key
  ESC [ 4 ~  *-- input only*

Delete-to-the-right-key
  ESC [ 3 ~  *-- input only*

PageUp-key
  ESC [ 5 ~  *-- input only*

PageDown-key
  ESC [ 6 ~  *-- input only*

Move-to-home-of-screen-upper-left
  ESC [ H  *-- output only*

Move-to-end-of-line
  ESC [ F  *-- output only*

Teleport-cursor-to-coordinate
  ESC [ *row* ; *col* H   *-- output only: rows and cols start counting at 1, not 0*

Clearscreen
  ESC [ 2 J  *-- output only*

Scroll-screen-up-one-line-keeping-cursor-where-it-is
  ESC [ S  *-- output only*

Scroll-screen-down-one-line-keeping-cursor-where-it-is
  ESC [ T  *-- output only*

Delete-to-the-left-of-cursor-ie-backspace
  ESC [ K  *-- output only*

Delete-at-the-cursor-toward-the-right
  ESC [ 1 K  *-- output only*



**XTERM codes:** *The following codes are for the XTERM emulation only*

Server-telling-client-to-resize-screen
  ESC [ 8 ; *newheight* ; *newwidth* t  *-- The height/width are in chars*

Server-telling-client-to-change-window-title
  ESC ] 2 ; *title string* BEL  *-- where BEL is the character normally 
  used to mean beep: control-G or 0x07.  But in this context it just marks
  the end of the title and shouldn't cause a beep.*
  Note this is NOT a typo that it uses a right-square-bracket ("]") here where
  all the other codes used a left-square-bracket ("[").  That's actually
  how the xterm control sequence for this really looks.


Any value not mentioned in the list above might still get sent, but you 
should be able to capture and ignore it.
