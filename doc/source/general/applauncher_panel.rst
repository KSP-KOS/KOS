kOS Control Panel
=================

As of kOS v0.15, kOS now makes use of Kerbal Space Program's built-in
Application Launcher toolbar, to open a config/status panel for kOS.

This panel behaves like the other display panels the launcher creates,
and operates mutually exclusively with them. (For example you can't
make the kOS App Control Panel appear at the same time as the stock
Resource display panel. Opening one toggles the other one off,
and visa versa.)

Here is an annotated image of the control panel and what it does:
