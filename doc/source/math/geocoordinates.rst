Geographic Coordinates
======================

.. contents:: Contents
    :local:
    :depth: 1

The ``GeoCoordinates`` object (also ``LATLNG``) represents a latitude and longitude pair, which is a location on the surface of a :ref:`Body <body>`.

Creation
--------

.. function:: LATLNG(lat,lng)

    :parameter lat: (deg) Latitude
    :parameter lng: (deg) Longitude
    :return: :struct:`GeoCoordinates`

    This function creates a :struct:`GeoCoordinates` object with the given
    latitude and longitude, assuming the current SHIP's Body is the body
    to make it for.

    Once created it can't be changed. The :attr:`GeoCoordinates:LAT` and
    :attr:`GeoCoordinates:LNG` suffixes are get-only (they cannot be
    set.) To switch to a new location, make a new call to :func:`LATLNG()`.

    If you wish to create a :struct:`GeoCoordinates` object for a latitude
    and longitude around a *different* body than the ship's current sphere
    of influence body, see :meth:`Body:GEOPOSITIONLATLNG` for a means to do that.

    It is also possible to obtain a :struct:`GeoCoordinates` from some suffixes of some other structures. For example::

        SET spot to SHIP:GEOPOSITION.

.. note::

    This type is serializable.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:BODY

    The :ref:`Celestial Body <body>` this position is attached to.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:LAT

    The latitude of this position on the surface.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:LNG

    The longitude of this position on the surface.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:DISTANCE

    Distance from the :ref:`CPU_Vessel <cpu vessel>` to this point on the surface.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:TERRAINHEIGHT

    Distance of the terrain above "sea level" at this geographical position. Negative numbers are below "sea level."

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:HEADING

    The *absolute* compass direction from the :ref:`CPU_Vessel <cpu vessel>` to this point on the surface.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:BEARING

    The *relative* compass direction from the :ref:`CPU_Vessel <cpu vessel>` to this point on the surface. For example, if the vessel is heading at compass heading 45, and the geo-coordinates location is at heading 30, then :attr:`GeoCoordinates:BEARING` will return -15.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:POSITION

    The ship-raw 3D position on the surface of the body, relative to the current ship's Center of mass.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:ALTITUDEPOSITION (altitude)

    The ship-raw 3D position above or below the surface of the body, relative to the current ship's Center of mass.  You pass in an altitude number for the altitude above "sea" level of the desired location.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:VELOCITY

    The (linear) velocity of this spot on the surface of the planet/moon, due to the rotation of the
    body causing that spot to move though space.
    (For example, on Kerbin at a sea level location, it would be 174.95 m/s eastward, and slightly
    more at higher terrain spots above sea level.)
    Note that this is returned as an :struct:`OrbitableVelocity`, meaning it isn't a vector but a
    pair of vectors, one called ``:orbit`` and one called ``:surface``.  Note that the
    surface-relative velocity you get from the ``:surface`` suffix isn't always zero like you might
    intuit because ``:surface`` gives you the velocity relative to the surface reference frame
    where ``SHIP`` is, which might not be the same latitude/longitude/altitude as where this
    Geocoordinates is.

.. attribute:: GeoCoordinates:ALTITUDEVELOCITY (altitude)

    This is the same as :attr:`GeoCoordinates:VELOCITY`, except that it lets you specify some
    altitude other than the surface terrain height.  You specify a (sea-level) altitude,
    and it will calculate based on a point at that altitude which may be above or below
    the actual surface at this latitude and longitude.  It will calculate as if you had some
    point fixed to the ground, like an imaginary tower bolted to the surface, but not at the
    ground's altitude.  (The body's rotation will impart a larger magnitude linear velocity
    on a locaton affixed to the body the farther that location is from the body's center).

Example Usage
-------------

::

    SET spot TO LATLNG(10, 20).     // Initialize point at latitude 10,
                                    // longitude 20

    PRINT spot:LAT.                 // Print 10
    PRINT spot:LNG.                 // Print 20

    PRINT spot:DISTANCE.            // Print distance from vessel to x
    PRINT spot:HEADING.             // Print the heading to the point
    PRINT spot:BEARING.             // Print the heading to the point
                                    // relative to vessel heading

    SET spot TO SHIP:GEOPOSITION.   // Make spot into a location on the
                                    // surface directly underneath the
                                    // current ship

    SET spot TO LATLNG(spot:LAT,spot:LNG+5). // Make spot into a new
                                             // location 5 degrees east
                                             // of the old one

    // Point nose of ship at a spot 100,000 meters altitude above a
    // particular known latitude of 50 east, 20.2 north:
    LOCK STEERING TO LATLNG(50,20.2):ALTITUDEPOSITION(100000).

    // A nice complex example:
    // -------------------------
    // Drawing an debug arrow in 3D space at the spot where the GeoCoordinate
    // "spot" is:
    // It starts at a position 100m above the ground altitude and is aimed down
    // at the spot on the ground:
    SET VD TO VECDRAWARGS(
                  spot:ALTITUDEPOSITION(spot:TERRAINHEIGHT+100),
                  spot:POSITION - spot:ALTITUDEPOSITION(TERRAINHEIGHT+100),
                  red, "THIS IS THE SPOT", 1, true).

    PRINT "THESE TWO NUMBERS SHOULD BE THE SAME:".
    PRINT (SHIP:ALTITIUDE - SHIP:GEOPOSITION:TERRAINHEIGHT).
    PRINT ALT:RADAR.
