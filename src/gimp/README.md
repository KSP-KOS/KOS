XCF files (Gimp)
----------------

The .xcf files here are in GIMP format.  They contain the full
layer information so you can edit the images easier.  The PNG
files they create are the result of exporting from GIMP.

As such, the .xcf files were added to GIT because they are,
essentially, the "source code" for the images.  However, they
don't need to be put into exported ZIP files for installing.

### terminal-icon.xcf

Most of the icons (all of them as of this writing) in PNG format
were actually created from this one Gimp .xcf file.  It has multiple
layers inside it, and you can see how toggling the visibility on
different layers can give you the different looks of the different
PNG files.  The PNG files were exported from this one file with just
different layers set to visible for different needs.
