# KSPedia for kOS
This contains **basic** information for kOS, and is not intended to replace the docs. This is intended to be used as a basic guide for players to use, but they should consult the docs if they need more information on a subject.

Make sure all panels are enabled before building (KSPAssets > Asset Compiler > Build All)

To add this to a kOS build, make sure to add the kos.ksp file (KOS/src/kOS KSPedia/AssetBundles) anywhere in the Gamedata/kOS folder

If you need any further information, contact @kna27
