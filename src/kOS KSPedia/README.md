# KSPedia for kOS
This contains **basic** information for kOS, and is not intended to replace the docs. This is intended to be used as a basic guide for players to use, but they should consult the docs if they need more information on a subject.

Install the [KSP Part Tools](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/160487-official-parttools/)

Make sure all panels are enabled before building (KSPAssets > Asset Compiler > Build All)

To add this to a kOS build, make sure to add the kos.ksp file (KOS/src/kOS KSPedia/AssetBundles) anywhere in the Gamedata/kOS folder
