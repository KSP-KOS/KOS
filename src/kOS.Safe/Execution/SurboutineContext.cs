    /// when user functions are implemented.)</p>
    /// 
    /// <p>At the moment it only contains the instruction pointer to return to.</p>
    /// 
    /// <p>Why isn't it just an integer then?</p>
    /// 
    /// <p>It was just an integer before, but that makes it impossible to tell the
    /// difference between an integer expression value on the stack and the
    /// function's return point.  Having a special type for storing the return
    /// pointer effectively puts section separators into the stack - everything
    /// in between two SubroutineContext records on the stack belongs to that same
    /// nesting level of function call.</p>
    /// 
    /// <p>It can also be expanded to include more things than the return IP.  For
    /// example if we ever want to implement local variables, it would make sense
    /// to store a reference to the Dictionary namespace of them in this context record, so it
    /// too can be popped back when returning from the routine.</p>
    /// 
    /// <p>It is also useful if we want to implement a premature abort from a routine
    /// (i.e. exit or return statement).  With a special named class like this on
    /// the stack at the point where the current subroutine was begun, it will be
    /// possible to identify how much of the top of the stack to erease if we want to
    /// abort prematurely and return (everything on top of the topmost SubroutineContext
    /// is the stuff that was added by the current routine).</p>
    /// 
    /// <p>It also makes it possible to implement varying arguments passed to a function
    /// this way, because we can find out how many of the objects on top of the stack are
    /// the parameters to the current function - When the function starts everything in
    /// the stack above where the SubroutineContext record is will be a parameter.  (Also,
    /// it should be possible to detect the wrong number of arguments better this way, for
    /// the same reason).</p>
