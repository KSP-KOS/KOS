// --------------------------------------------

// Only define a ModuleCargoPart for this part if the KSP version is high
// enough that it's safe to do so. 
//
// ModuleCargoPart was first meant to be used by modders starting in
// KSP v1.11.0, but a broken incomplete version of a class with that
// same name secretly existed in earlier versions of KSP's DLL. So
// if you unconditionally add it in the Part.cfg regardless of
// KSP version you'll invoke that earlier broken version of the
// class and that makes the part's PAW fail to open in the VAB/SPH.
//
// The Size2LFB_v2 engine was first added to stock in KSP v1.11.0.
// That's being used here as a kludgy proxy test for the KSP version
// because ModuleManager hasn't added a KSP version check feature yet.
