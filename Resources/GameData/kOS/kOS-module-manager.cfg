//
// ADD the KOSNameTag to all parts in the game.
//
//    THE FOLLOWING EXPLANATION IS FOR ISSUE #2764
//
// The "[!KOSNameTag]" rule below attempted to prevent duplicates
// in a part, but it doesn't entirely succeed at that in the
// case of KerbalEVA parts if the installation has all the DLCs,
// due to a wacky messy way SQUAD implemented the alternate
// kerbal types (with or without vintage suits, with or without
// the ability to plant ground science, etc).  SQUAD implements
// them as entirely different kerbal parts, then smashes their
// definitions together later after Modulemanager is done.
// ModuleManager is helpless to notice the duplication that will
// cause because they were two *different* parts when it was looking
// at them.
//
// Therefore there is extra code inside kOS's C# code to additionally
// enforce the "no more than one KOSNameTag" rule, in its OnAwake().
// You *cannot* force more than one KOSNameTag to exist in a part
// no matter what you do in ModuleManager now, because KOSNameTag
// itself refuses to allow it.
//
@PART[*]:FOR[kOS]:HAS[!KOSNameTag]
{
	MODULE
	{
		name = KOSNameTag
	}
}

//
// The following is commented out because it was an alternate possible
// fix to #2764 that @Poodmund worked on for me, and even though I'm not
// going with it, it's saved here for reference to look at later should
// we change our mind and want to go to this instead:
//
// (In a nutshell, this removes the extra KOSNameTag PartModules from
// those specfic part definitions in the known specific DLC folders
// that trigger this exact problem, rather than creating a generic
// solution that says "there can be only one, ever"):
//
// @PART[kerbalEV*]:HAS[~name[*Future],@MODULE[ModuleScienceExperiment]:HAS[#experimentID[ROCScience]]]:AFTER[kOS]
// {
//    !MODULE[KOSNameTag]{}
// }
