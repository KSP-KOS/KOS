### Purpose of this folder

When Kerbal Space Program got updated to version 1.8, it came with
a large Unity engine upgrade that invalidated older part mesh files.
But because it may be necessary to build a version of kOS that
still works on older versions of KSP (probably for Realism Overhaul,
which is always several revisions behind), I'm keeping a copy
of what the .mu mesh files used to look like before the KSP 1.8 update
here.  If you need to build a back-port for a version of KSP earlier 
than 1.8, you will need to use these .mu files instead of the official
ones.
